## Structure ##

* `./api/`:
* `./assets/`: raw media files that are needed by the UI, but are not part UI logic.
* `./hosted/`: destroyed, created, and populated in the UI build process. This is the resting location of final hosted UI files that are available to the end user's browser.
* `./ui_src/`: human readable files that express the UI.
